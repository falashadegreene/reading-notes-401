# The Command Line

The command line tool is interesting and useful practice when working with your computer's file system in a efficient manner. I remember how intimidated I was when learing about the terminal. I enjoyed learning more about how to utilize the terminal and get comfortable with the commands. Here are a few additonal things I learned while going through the tutorials.

- Using the up arrows to track previous file names instead of retyping everything out and possibly causing spelling errors.

- The tab key to auto complete a file name.

- Using the command -a to see hidden files is useful. I didn't realize that files could be hidden and ls doesn't necessarily list all hidden files.

- rmdir is a useful command. In the past I typically just remove or trash the directory manually be clicking the file to delete. This is a helpful and quick command.

- The -r (recursive) option is interesting to see all files within a directory to continue to make copies of multiple directories.
