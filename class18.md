## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

## Ceasar Cipher

is a substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount. Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies. (credit: https://www.khanacademy.org/)

## Things I want to know more about

I'm interested in seeing how we can implement Encryption in our dev projects.
