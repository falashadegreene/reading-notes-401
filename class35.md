# Graphs

- **Vertex** - A data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- **Edge** - An edge is a relationship between two nodes.
- **Neighbor** - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes
- **Degree** - Is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- **Undirected Graph** - A graph that each edge is undirected or bi-directional
- **Directed Graph** - can also be called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
- **connected** - A graph that has all of vertices or nodes have at least one edge.
- **Disconnected** - A graph where some vertices may not have edges.
- **Acyclic Graph** -  is a directed graph without cycles
