## Why this important

This topic matters because it will help me prepare for the tech industry by indentifying my strenths to allow me to become more marketable during my career search journey.

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

In addition to technical skills, I bring a great deal of excellent soft skills to this career. I demonstrate leadership and the ability to work well in a team with a customer focused mindset.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
