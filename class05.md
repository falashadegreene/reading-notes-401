## vocabulary/definition list

- **Fibonacci Series** - The Fibonacci series is the sequence of numbers (also called Fibonacci numbers), where every number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, such that the first two terms are '0' and '1'

- **Lucas Numbers** - The Lucas series has the same recursive relationship as the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but with different starting values ('2' and '1')

- **Recursion** - Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result. (credit: https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

- **Dictionary** - Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

- **Binary Search** - Binary search is a searching algorithm which is used to search an element from a sorted array

- **Sequential Search** - The sequential search is a searching algorithm that checks each item in a data structure from the beginning to find the target value (credit: https://thecleverprogrammer.com/)

- Big O (I'm still trying to understand this concept myself) - The notation ÎŸ(n) is the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. (credit: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_data_structure/python_big_o_notation.htm)
