## vocabulary/definition list

- **Linked List** - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

- **Singly** - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

- **Doubly** - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node

- **Node** - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

- **Linear data structures** - Means a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

- **Non-linear data structures** - Are items that donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

- **Static data structures** - Data structures that grow and shrink as you need them to by allocating and deallocating memory from a place called the heap

- **Big O Notation** - is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm. it is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.
