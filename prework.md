## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

Growth mindset can be learned with an open mind. Having a growth mindset can allow you to see challenges as possibilities to learn and gain more knowledge instead of seeing things as barriers or a stuntness in your ability to take on new information. It is the difference in saying I may not understand this yet, but with practice I'll eventually get it. Verses saying I don't understand it which means I'm not cut out for it. When learning somthing new its important practice growth mindset.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

As Angela Lee explained in her talk, Grit is about perseverance and the ability to understand that failure is apart of the journey. Consistancy to me is apart of having grit because no matter what the outcome is or how you feel about your progress, contining will get you accross the finish line in your reach to meet your goals.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

Alain's philosophy on success were interesting. My thought on success is that you can indentify your own meaning of success and the road you take to get there. As someone who pivoted into learning tech which I have a zero traditional background in, my track to reaching my goals might be perceived as not being a linear path. However my success is defined by me and not how others perceive it.

## Emotional intelligence

Emotional intelligence is something that I constantley try to improve with myself. I think it helps improve professional relationships and how you work with teams and leaders. It can be a learned skill and with the right awarness can be practiced daily.

## Biases

I've taken this assessment before, but I truly believe that bias self awareness isn't something you master, and is a constant learning curve. We all have our blind spots, but I think if you demonstrate openness to other perspectives and experiences it allows for growth. My hope is to improve on making a conscious effort to connect and network with someone new in my organizations or professional environments.
