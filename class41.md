# React 4

## Dynamic Routes

Next.Js allows the developer to make pages with paths that depend on external data. It creates dynamic urls in Next.JS

 To statically generate pages with dynamic routes

 1. create React component to render the page.

 2. use `getStaticPaths`s that returns an array of possible values for id
 3. us `getstaticProps` that fetches the data for the post id 

## Next.JS Deployment 

Create Vercel account and import `nextjs-blog` repo on vercel, then vercel will build out the application and provide url links. Once you click on the link you can see starter page.

## Things I would like to know more about 

Looking forward to seeing more about the dynamic routes.
